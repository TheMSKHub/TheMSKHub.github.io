### **Throwback to Our Plus Two Days** 🎒  
- Prethyekich parayan onnulla, but it was a great time during the plus two and following, Ini bhakki AI paranjolum 

- **The Friendship Upgrade** 🚀:  
  - You tolerated my terrible jokes and rubbish talks, and firstly I apologise If ive ever hurt you, So heres something I did as a surprise, which is not actually a surprise.
  - I survived your *"I’ll-only-study-the-night-before"* chaos (and secretly admired your confidence).

### **The 18th Birthday Portrait Debacle** 🎨  
Let’s revisit this:  
- **The "Art"**: A portrait so bad, it made stick figures look like Da Vinci.  
- **The Truth**: I knew it was terrible… but you smiled anyway. That meant everything.  
- **The Real Gift**: You taught me friendship isn’t about perfection—it’s about showing up, even when you suck at drawing. 🙌

### **Where We Are Now** 🌍  
- **You**: Future Dr. Srirenjini, saving lives in Kozhikode 🩺✨.  
- **Me**: Still Figuring out should I start business or should I leave my house, still drawing questionable art 🖍️ (but *slightly* better houses now!).  
- **What I Miss**:  
  - Your laugh when I tried to explain quantum physics using *"vibes"*.  
  - The way you’d say *"Stop overthinking!"*… while we both overthought everything.

### **No Pressure, Just Gratitude** 💌  
- **Why I’m Writing This**:  
  - To say **thank you** for being the kind of friend who treasures terrible portraits.  
  - To remind you that even if we talk once a year, I’ll always cheer for you. 🥤📣  
- **No Strings Attached**, but if you ever want to:  
  - Swap MBBS stories for my depression stories and other disappointments, Im all ears.  
  - Judge my *"improved"* art (spoiler: now with 10% fewer blobs).  
  - Reminisce about the way you took you stance as a Kathakali when you tried to skip a rock through the water at Munnar, and the memories of you talking with me just brings me good mindfulness when i think.

### **A Tiny Wish** 🌙  
May your stethoscope always hear good news, your coffee stay strong, and your heart never forget the goofy friend who still owes you a better portrait. 🖼️  

---  
Daa to be honest I sometimes really wished if you were a best friend of mine, in that case I have a little Asooya towards Abiram, But still you are a best friend of mine and I really want to sustain it for a life time, maybe see ya on the day of delivery (of money plant or cactus). Until then I pray to god for you to have a better life and happiness in your life and I am happy that I took effort to do this, which is the max I could do right now for you. 
###### P.S. – If this is too mushy, pretend I sent a meme instead. 😎

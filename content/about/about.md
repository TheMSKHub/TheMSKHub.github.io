# 🌍 The Roots of My Journey

"True growth begins when we lift others while climbing" - MSK

## 🔥 The Spark That Lit My Fire

### The Rickshaw Ride That Changed Everything
During high school, my teacher shared the story of **Irfan Alam** and his SammaaN Foundation. It was a moment that stayed with me:

> "Solutions hide in plain sight—true change begins when we see dignity in struggle and potential in ordinary moments."

**What SammaaN Achieved**:
- 🚲 Redesigned rickshaws to include snacks, drinks, and ads (30% revenue to pullers)
- 📚 Funded education for 5,000+ children of rickshaw families
- 🏥 Provided healthcare and insurance to 8,000+ families

This story taught me that **empathy + innovation = sustainable change**.

## 🌿 Why Plants? A Destiny Revealed

### The Night My Father Said, "Let’s Grow Again"
Two months ago, I was lost—unsure whether to pursue tech, hospitality, or something else entirely. Then, my father called me over:

> _"Selu, why not restart our nursery? You’re studying online... this is our chance."_

It was like the universe whispered the answer I’d been searching for.  

**Why It Clicked**:
1. 🌱 **Family Legacy**: We’d run a nursery 3 years prior but had to pause due to family hardships.  
2. 🤝 **Shared Dream**: My father, a government employee, always dreamed of returning to agriculture.  
3. 💡 **Purpose**: Plants merged my loves—science, creativity, and community.
